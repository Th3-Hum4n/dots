 #+TITLE: NixOS Configuration
Nix is cool.
* Before installing
Do this I guess
#+begin_src sh
mv /etc/nixos/hardware-configuration.nix .
rm -r /etc/nixos
ln -s /home/viz/lib/nix /etc/nixos
#+end_src

* Misc
- I don't use ~sudo~, I use +multiplexd's+ ~doas~ instead
- ~nix-shell~ can use ~mksh~. See ~user/mksh.nix conditionalFunctions.nix~
- +I can't get home-manager's graphical services to launch even if my life depended on it+
  I got it working by importing ~XDG_CONFIG_HOME~ in ~xsession~ (see ~user/xsession.nix~)
** How I got graphical services working
When you set a custom ~XDG_CONFIG_HOME~, home-manager installs the
service files there but ~systemd~ does not know the newly set value (it
tries to lookup user services in ~~/.config~ instead). So you have to
import ~XDG_CONFIG_HOME~ from the environment.
