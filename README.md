Config files for my linux setup.

Most of the stuff are distro-independent, but some automation scripts are arch-dependent. I'll make scripts which automate things I need for void as well.

I have used programs from other repos, mostly [mitch](https://github.com/MitchWeaver)'s repo. I took relevant bits from his dwm which enables the user to use lemonbar and integrated that to mine.

Currently the dots repo is not well-updated and maintained. My dwm config might not work as exepected, since I haven't updated the `bin` folder yet.

**Note**: You need a couple of scripts from mitch's bin repo for lemonbar to work. I'm not going to include that since it is **not** my code. All the relevant code needed can be guessed just by looking at the error messages.
